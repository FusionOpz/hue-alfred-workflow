![Admin](/screenshots/admin.png)

## Installation

1. **[Download the workflow](https://github.com/benknight/hue-alfred-workflow/releases/download/v2.4/Philips.Hue.Controller.v2.4.alfredworkflow)**

2. After adding the workflow to Alfred, press the button on top of the Hue bridge and then run this command within 30 seconds:

```
-hue set-bridge
```

This command attempts to find the bridge on your local network.  If it fails, you can specify the bridge's IP address.  For example, if your bridge's IP is `192.168.42.126`:

```
-hue set-bridge 192.168.42.126
```

## Features

For convenience basic light control is available using the `hue` keyword, while all admin features are accessed using `-hue` keyword.

### Light control

Control the on/off state, color, and brightness for any individual light, or all lights at once.

### Presets

Quickly save the current state as a named preset.

Then load them:

### Easy light groups

Control or save the state of just subset of lights so that you can have group presets or avoid turning your roommate's light off by accident.

![Set Group](/screenshots/group.png)

This affects which lights will be changed when setting the state for "All lights" using the workflow.

To reset the group to all lamps again, use `-hue set-group 0`

### Hotkeys

This workflow uses a special action string format that you can use to create a hotkey for any action you could otherwise perform using the "hue" keyword:

```
lights:[all,1,2,â€¦]:[off,on,bri,rename,effect,color,reminder]:<value>
```

```
presets:load:<name>
```

Examples:

```
lights:all:on
lights:all:off
lights:all:color:random
lights:all:color:red
lights:1:color:random
lights:1:color:bada55
lights:1:reminder:180 (seconds)
lights:1:bri:50 (percent)
lights:2:rename:Kitchen
lights:3:effect:colorloop
presets:load:Red
```

You can turn any one of these into a hotkey by going to Alfred Preferences > Workflows, selecting the Philips Hue Controller workflow, and then adding a hotkey action from the dropdown (click the + icon and select Triggers > Hotkey).  You then set the text argument to the action string, and then connect that to the same block as the other preloaded hotkeys.
