This workflow contains commands for controlling Philips Hue lights, all of which
are accessed by typing "hue" or "-hue" into Alfred.  "hue" will connect to the
Philips Hue bridge and allow you to edit the state of your Hue lights.
"-hue" is for general workflow configuration including bridge & group settings,
as well as preset management.

1. How do I manually specify the bridge's IP address?

  The workflow will attempt to automatically locate the Hue bridge on your
  network. But if you know your bridge's IP, you can set it manually using the
  `-hue set-bridge` command.For example:

    -hue set-bridge 192.168.1.4
